# QRYou

## Description

*Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

This website is designed to help connect potential employers or customers with your professional resume and portfolio. We have created a place to compile your work history, prior projects, interests, assets, and ways to contact you using whatever means of communication you prefer.  After signing up and filling in the essential information through easy prompts, your personal QR code will be generated to attach to your social media platforms, apply to a business card, or keep in your photo reel so that it can quickly be scanned using any smartphone camera to allow your professional information to be viewed.

- What was your motivation?
As Junior Web Developers, we were motivated to generate a creative way to market ourselves to potential employers or customers who could benefit from our skills while setting ourselves apart from the traditional avenue to the first contact.


- What problem does it solve?
This website allows for a professional to have a single space for all their work, social media platforms, and general connection opportunities. This limits time employers/customers could spend researching you professionally as everything will be in one place and ready for them to study.

- What did you learn?
Throughout this project we learned the basics of working as a group.  This includes merging branches and working through merge conflicts, as well as, identifying strengths and weaknesses to delegate individual tasks while continuing to work together. Additionally, we learned that research skills can be as important as functional skills when creating complex code with requirements such as the ones in this first group project.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
